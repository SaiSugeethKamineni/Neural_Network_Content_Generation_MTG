Neural Network Content Generation - Magic the Gathering

Deep Learning Systems Capstone Project

-- Developed models to predict color and card type of a ‘Magic the Gathering’ game card using its artwork image as input.

-- Used style transfer methods to generate new artwork for possible new cards, aiding in new content generation.

-- Investigated the results and proposed further steps needed to aid content generation in Magic and such other games.
